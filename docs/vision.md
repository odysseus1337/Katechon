## The Vision of The Katechon

To create an ecosystem of knowledge and decentralized tools that:
- Empower individuals to escape algorithmic manipulation
- Support governance systems based on transparency, consent, and freedom
- Create alternatives to surveillance-based infrastructure
- Preserve meaningful human connections and epistemic integrity

## Three-Phase Roadmap
1. **Resistance** – Educational material and critiques of current systems
2. **Formation** – Community building, governance models, DAO experiments
3. **Creation** – Tools, platforms, and content that embody the Katechon ethos
