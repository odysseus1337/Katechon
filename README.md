# The Katechon

**A digital resistance. A new architecture for human freedom.**

The Katechon is a research and development initiative dedicated to building and defending decentralized, ethical, and liberating systems in the age of algorithmic control. We explore the intersection of technology, freedom, epistemology, and myth.

## What We Do
- Research and critique centralized power structures (surveillance capitalism, algorithmic control, digital totalitarianism)
- Develop concepts, frameworks, and tools for decentralized governance and digital freedom
- Foster a community of thinkers, builders, and rebels committed to protecting human consciousness and dignity

üõ°Ô∏è *"We are the ones who restrain."*
